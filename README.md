#### A homework assignment we work on together!
## What problem does the Observer pattern help solve?
### A). This allows the subject and  observer to form a publish-subscribe relationship, so that if you had a problem where you need multiple objects updated in the same way then the Observer pattern would be able to solve this. It decouples the observer from the object, the subject doesnâ€™t need to know anything special about its observers. When the subject does generate an event (this event being based on whatever the subject triggers even, odds, etc)  it will just pass it to each of the observers. 

## How would you describe the Observer pattern?
### A). 

## Where is polymorphism used in this pattern?
### A). 

## Did the UML diagrams make the coding more straightforward?
### A).
