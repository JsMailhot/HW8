#### A homework assignment we work on together!
## What problem does the Observer pattern help solve?
### A). This allows the subject and  observer to form a publish-subscribe relationship, so that if you had a problem where you need multiple objects updated in the same way then the Observer pattern would be able to solve this. It decouples the observer from the object, the subject doesnâ€™t need to know anything special about its observers. When the subject does generate an event (this event being based on whatever the subject triggers even, odds, etc)  it will just pass it to each of the observers. 

## How would you describe the Observer pattern?
### A). Our Obsever pattern is based on an Array List which based on the Subjects (subscribers) if they generate an event then it will pass to the observers which will inform any updates or changes needed based on the event.

## Where is polymorphism used in this pattern?
### A). Polymorphism is when class objects inherit from the parent class and the class  has functions with the same name but with different behaviors. This polymorphism takes place as the subscribers all have their own implementation of an abstract method that would call the notifySubsrciber based on the event that is triggered. 

## Did the UML diagrams make the coding more straightforward?
### A). It did help with giving us a bit of a starting ground, it also helped with identifying the Observer Pattern with the arrows defining which is which. We still had to add some methods and variables but it did help give us an idea of the relationships.
